# decentralized-marketplaces
A list of decentralized marketplaces and decentralized marketplace protocols. Decentralized marketplaces are software applications that enable discovery between online buyers and sellers without having to rely on a central third-party server. Decentralized marketplace protocols are software standards that enable different marketplace interfaces to be interoperable with one another. These protocols are often implemented in reference applications that can be used to access a decentralized marketplace or network of marketplaces.
